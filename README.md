### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my Ph.D. in Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) applied to build an Energy Management System (EMS)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more deeper in DRL
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate with who want to apply DRL to make and study agents, control, decision-making, teach the machine to do crazy things...
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help sharpening my understanding of maths, physics, engineering, and other fields when helping the world is about.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything. I'll try to help, and if I can't, I'll try to help in looking for help. 
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Try here: https://www.iit.comillas.edu/people/ddominguez (tell me how you reach me)
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: No worried about it. Call me whatever you feel more comfortable, but try to keep it simple, understandable, and feeling smart. If this does not help, try with he/him/Ã©l

Some about me:

I'm a very fanatic of Reinforcement Learning (RL) and any kind of optimization procedures (and modeling). This field is soo big I cannot know all about it. Still, I'm focusing on understanding RL well using Deep Learning, a.k.a. Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL).

My ultimate passion is to help others to help each other and make a better society, i.e., increase happiness in the world while maintaining the "live and let live" thinking.
